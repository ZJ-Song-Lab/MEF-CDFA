Edge-Aware SAR Ship Detection: Multi-Scale Edge-Semantic Fusion and Contrast-Driven Feature Aggregation
‚ú® Highlights
General and Plug-and-Play: Our framework is a universal component that can be easily integrated into mainstream object detection architectures, including the YOLO and RT-DETR series.

Significant Performance Improvement: On public datasets like SSDD, our method significantly improves detection accuracy while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Edge-Aware: A unique modular design that effectively leverages crucial edge information in SAR images, solving issues of blurry edges and inaccurate localization common in traditional methods.

üéØ Methodology Overview
To address the challenges in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image ship detection, we propose a general framework called Edge-Aware SAR Ship Detection. The framework consists of two key modules:

Multi-Scale Edge-Semantic Fusion (MEF) Module:

Function: Solves the problem of edge information loss during deep network propagation.

How it works: Extracts high-resolution edge features from shallow convolutional layers and progressively fuses them into the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), working synergistically with deep semantic features.

Contrast-Driven Feature Aggregation (CDFA) Module:

Function: Enhances the model's feature discriminability in complex backgrounds, reducing false positives and missed detections.

How it works: Uses Haar wavelet transforms for multi-scale decomposition, combined with an attention mechanism for dynamic weighting, to aggregate features that enhance the contrast between targets and the background.
